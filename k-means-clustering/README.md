## Project: k-means Clustering of Movie Ratings

## Project Overview

Say you're a data analyst at Netflix and you want to explore the similarities and differences in people's tastes in movies based on how they rate different movies. Can understanding these ratings contribute to a movie recommendation system for users? Let's dig into the data and see.

The data we'll be using comes from the wonderful [MovieLens](https://movielens.org/) [user rating dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).
