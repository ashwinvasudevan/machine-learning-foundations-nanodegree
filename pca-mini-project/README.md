# PCA Mini-Project 
### Faces recognition example using eigenfaces and SVMs
Our discussion of PCA spent a lot of time on theoretical issues, so in this mini-project weâ€™ll ask you to play around with some sklearn code. The eigenfaces code is interesting and rich enough to serve as the testbed for this entire mini-project.

Note:
The dataset used in this example is a preprocessed excerpt of the
"[Labeled Faces in the Wild](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/)", aka [LFW_ Download](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/lfw-funneled.tgz) (233MB). [Original source](http://scikit-learn.org/0.15/auto_examples/applications/face_recognition.html).
